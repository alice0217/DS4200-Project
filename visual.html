      Data Visualization: How are Countries Different in Netflix Movies and
      Shows Productions?
    </h1>
    <h3>Group 15: Joseph Trisnandi, Khanh Nguyen, I Man Liu</h3>
    <h2 style="width: 100%">Overall Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In the ever-evolving landscape of entertainment, streaming platforms have
      become the go-to destination for a diverse range of content. Among these,
      Netflix is a popular platform that provides a wide collection of TV series
      and movies to suit the diverse tastes of its global audiences. In this
      project, we want to analyze a collection of TV series and movies provided
      by a Netflix dataset, aiming to uncover the connection and impact of
      production origins and their released Netflix TV shows and movies.
    </p>
    <p>
      More specifically, for every country in the dataset, we would like to find
      out its movies & TV show split, the trend in the number of released
      content each year, the average IMDB score of each genre, and so on.
      Through these data visualizations, we can compare between different
      countries. Hence, we can find the answer to the question of how TV shows
      and movies on Netflix produced by different countries differ in terms of
      attributes such as their show type, genres, IMDB score, IMDB votes, and so
      on.
    </p>
    <h2 style="width: 100%">Introduction to the data</h2>
    <p>
      The data we gathered comes from one source on Kaggle: Netflix TV Shows and
      Movies which has two files titles.csv and credits.csv, but we will only
      use titles.csv. It has 5850 rows and 15 features. This data set was
      created to list all movies and shows available on Netflix streaming, and
      analyze the data to find interesting facts. As of the recentness of data,
      the data was acquired in July 2022 containing data available in the US and
      it wass lastly updated a year ago. Using the raw data, we have engineered
      some additional features to easily represent them using visualization
      libraries.We also added natural earth country data and merged with our
      existing dataframe. The information about the features that were used in
      this visualization are listed in the following table:

    <p>When analyzing the overall map, we observe distinct patterns that most of Europe, Asia, 
      and parts of Africa have higher average shows and movies runtimes, with movies averaging 
      between 97 to 114 minutes and shows between 37 to 60 minutes. On the other hand, 
      most of North and South America tend to have lower average shows and movies runtimes, 
      ranging from 20 to 97 minutes for movies and 3 to 37 minutes for shows. As you clicked 
      on each of the country in the continent, you will explore more of Netflix Movies and

          This boxplot was created using the Seaborn library. The chart
          effectively visualizes the differences in production runtimes across
          the content types and the three production countries represented. This
          allows for easy comparison and insight of country tendencies in the
          data.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key observation is that Movie production generally have a higher
          runtime compared to shows. Moreover, there is a broader distribution
          of runtimes for movies than for shows, with Indian-produced movies
          displaying the widest range, spanning from 60 to 200 minutes.
          Additionally, Indian production companies also have the longest median
          movie runtimes of around 135 minutes. On the other hand, the Korean
          production companies have the longest show runtimes, with a median
          around 60 minutes.

        <p>
          The scatter plot presented shows a compelling distribution of IMDB scores 
          against the number of IMDB votes for a collection of TV shows and movies. 
          The X-axis is scaled from 0 to 10, representing the range of possible 
          IMDB scores, while the Y-axis accounts for the volume of IMDB votes, 
          extending into the millions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The density of points grows thinner at both extremities of the rating spectrum 
          but shows a particular uptick in the number of votes for shows and movies 
          with higher ratings, especially beyond the score of 6 to 8. This indicates a potential 
          correlation where higher-rated/quality shows and movies on Netflix also tend to be more 
          popular or discussed among viewers. Moreover, the spread of votes across shows and movies 
          hinting at the diverse tastes among Netflix's audience from different countries.

        The stacked bar plot above illustrates the distribution of shows and
        movies across various countries on Netflix, utilizing a color scheme
        reminiscent of Netflix's branding to enhance clarity and user
        interpretation. The red bars represent the proportion of shows, while
        the black bars depict the proportion of movies. With a total of 109
        bars, each corresponding to a distinct country, the plot serves as a
        comprehensive overview of countries show and movie production patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notably, the plot reveals intriguing insights into the content offerings
        of different countries. Some countries, such as Ghana and Burkina Faso,
        out of all their productions on Netflix, movies take up 100% while shows
        take up 0%. Conversely, countries like Belarus and Croatia are the total
        opposite with a 100% of shows and 0% movies. Moreover, a significant
        observation emerges from the large number of black bars, signifying that
        on the Netflix platform, movies are more prevalent than shows across a
        greater number of countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Delving deeper, notable disparities in content distribution are apparent
        among prominent nations. For instance, while the United States
        predominantly showcases movies, Japan and South Korea lean towards a
        surplus of TV shows. These variations reflect unique cultural
        preferences and production trends within each country's entertainment
        industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, the stacked bar plot illuminates the diverse landscape of
        content distribution on Netflix, highlighting regional preferences and
        industry dynamics, and underscoring the importance of countries to cater
        to diverse audience preferences in the global market.

      This graph, created using the Altair visualization library, displays the
      number of content releases (movies and shows) over time by the top 3
      production countries: the US, Korea and India. The line graph shows a
      steady, gradual increase from the 1940s to the late 1990s, followed by a
      sharp, almost vertical rise in the past two decades. The observed trends
      may be influenced by various factors, such as advancements in technology,
      the rise of streaming platforms, changes in consumer demand, and shifts in
      the entertainment industry landscape. The graph differentiates between
      movie and show releases, with the movie line (in black) and the show line
      (in red) exhibiting distinct patterns. Despite the overall surge in
      content releases, a slight retraction is evident beginning around 2020,
      which may be attributed to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
      Furthermore, an analysis of the most and least popular genres among the
      top three production countries reveals that drama and comedy content are
      the most popular, whereas genres such as western, war, and sports exhibit
      comparatively lower popularity levels.

    <p>
      The network visualized by the Folium library illustrates collaborations
      between countries in producing movies and shows available on Netflix. Each
      edge between two countries signifies a collaborative effort in creating
      content. Notably, certain countries exhibit high degrees within the
      network, indicating extensive collaborations with numerous other
      countries. France, Great Britain, and the USA stand out prominently in
      this regard, suggesting that the movies and shows produced by these
      nations often involve partnerships with a diverse range of international
      counterparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of particular interest is the thickness of edges, which reflects the
      frequency of collaborations between pairs of countries. The thicker the
      edge, the more frequent the collaborations. For instance, the connection
      between Great Britain and the USA appears notably thicker compared to
      others, indicating a robust history of joint productions between these two
      countries. Overall, the network appears dense, indicating a widespread
      network of collaborations among countries in the film and television
      industry. However, there are outliers, such as KN (Saint Kitts and Nevis)
      and LK (Sri Lanka), with a low degree of one, suggesting limited
      collaborative engagements with other countries in the database we used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Analyzing this network provides valuable insights into the global dynamics
      of content creation and collaboration in the entertainment industry. It
      highlights the interconnectedness of countries in producing diverse and
      culturally rich content for platforms like Netflix, while also
      underscoring the varied levels of engagement among different nations.
      Further analysis of specific collaborations and patterns within the
      network could offer deeper insights into the dynamics of international
      partnerships in filmmaking and television production.
