      Data Visualization: How are Countries Different in Netflix Movies and
      Shows Productions?
    </h1>
    <h3>Group 15: Joseph Trisnandi, Khanh Nguyen, I Man Liu</h3>
    <h2 style="width: 100%">Overall Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In the ever-evolving landscape of entertainment, streaming platforms have
      become the go-to destination for a diverse range of content. Among these,
      Netflix is a popular platform that provides a wide collection of TV series
      and movies to suit the diverse tastes of its global audiences. In this
      project, we want to analyze a collection of TV series and movies provided
      by a Netflix dataset, aiming to uncover the connection between production
      origins and their released Netflix TV shows and movies.
    </p>
    <p>
      More specifically, for every country in the dataset, we would like to find
      out its movies & TV show split, the trend in the number of released
      content each year, the correlation between IMDB votes and IMDB scores, and
      so on. Through these data visualizations, we can compare between different
      countries. Hence, we can find the answer to the question of how TV shows
      and movies on Netflix produced by different countries differ in terms of
      attributes such as their show type, genres, IMDB score, IMDB votes, and so
      on.

    <p>
      The data we gathered comes from one source on Kaggle:
      <a
        href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies?select=titles.csv"
        target="_blank"
        >Netflix TV Shows and Movies</a
      >. Movies which has two files titles.csv and credits.csv, but we will only
      use titles.csv. It has 5850 rows and 15 features. This data set was
      created to list all movies and shows available on Netflix streaming, and
      analyze the data to find interesting facts. As of the recentness of data,
      the data was acquired in July 2022 containing data available in the US and
      it was lastly updated a year ago. Using the raw data, we have engineered
      some additional features to easily represent them using visualization
      libraries. We also added

      <span style="color: #c83c44">Interaction Guide: </span>
      Following is an interactive visual representation for the whole world. By
      zooming in or hovering over the map, users can explore details about each
      continent and country. The 2 color layers indicate the average show
      runtime and average movie runtime of each country. When click on a
      country, additional information about other factors related to movies and
      shows produced in that country will be revealed.

    ></iframe>
    <p>
      To generate the overall data visualization, our group created a new
      dataframe that generalizes all the movies and shows in the dataset. For
      every country, we calculate the total number of shows, total number of
      movies, average show runtime, average movie runtime, average imdb score,
      average imdb votes and so on so that the readers can get some general
      information about a specific country.
    </p>
    <p>
      When analyzing the overall map, we observe distinct patterns that most of
      Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa have higher average shows and movies
      runtimes, with movies averaging between 97 to 114 minutes and shows
      between 37 to 60 minutes. On the other hand, most of North and South
      America tend to have lower average shows and movies runtimes, ranging from
      20 to 97 minutes for movies and 3 to 37 minutes for shows. As you clicked
      on each of the country in the continent, you will explore more of Netflix
      Movies and Shows Productions information such as the latest movies release
      year, average imdb score, average tmdb popularity, etc. However, it's also
      worth noting that some countries like Belarus and Algeria have null
      average show or movie runtime because there are no shows or movies
      produced by them on Netflix.
    </p>
    <p>
      This overall data visualization helps us understand the difference in
      average show and movie runtimes in different countries. Moreover, their
      more detailed information shown in tooltip helps us understand the
      diversity in Netflix content production across different regions. It
      highlights regional preferences and trends in show and movie runtimes,
      providing insights into cultural and entertainment preferences worldwide.
      Users can gain a deeper understanding of how Netflix content varies
      globally, enriching their knowledge of international media landscapes.

        The stacked bar plot above illustrates the distribution of shows and
        movies across various countries on Netflix, utilizing a color scheme
        reminiscent of Netflix's branding to enhance clarity and user
        interpretation. The red bars represent the proportion of shows, while
        the black bars depict the proportion of movies. With a total of 109
        bars, each corresponding to a distinct country, the plot serves as a
        comprehensive overview of countries show and movie production patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notably, the plot reveals intriguing insights into the content offerings
        of different countries. Some countries, such as Ghana and Burkina Faso,
        all of their content on Netflix are movies. On the other hand, countries
        like Belarus and Croatia are the total opposite with only shows and no
        movies. Moreover, a significant observation emerges from the large
        number of black bars, signifying that on the Netflix platform, movies
        are more prevalent than shows across a greater number of countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Delving deeper, noticeable disparities in content distribution are
        apparent among prominent nations. For instance, while the United States
        predominantly showcases movies, Japan and South Korea lean towards a
        surplus of TV shows. These variations reflect unique cultural
        preferences and production trends within each country's entertainment
        industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, the stacked bar plot illuminates the diverse landscape of
        content distribution on Netflix, highlighting regional preferences and
        industry dynamics, and underscoring the importance of countries to cater
        to diverse audience preferences in the global market.

        <img src="boxplot.svg" style="height: 500px" />
        <p>
          This side-by-side boxplot was created using the Seaborn library. The
          chart effectively visualizes the differences in production runtimes
          across the content types and the three production countries
          represented. This allows for easy comparison and insight of country
          tendencies in the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key observation is that movie production generally has a higher
          runtime compared to shows. Moreover, there is a broader distribution
          of runtimes for movies than for shows, with Indian-produced movies
          displaying the widest range, spanning from 60 to 200 minutes.
          Additionally, Indian-produced movies also have the longest median
          runtimes of around 135 minutes. On the other hand, the Korean-produced
          shows have the longest runtimes, with a median around 60 minutes, with
          a lower quartile of 50 minutes, longer than the upper quartile of US

        <h2>IMDB Votes vs. IMDB Score of Top 3 Countries Scatter Plot</h2>
        <img src="scatterplot.png" style="height: 450px; width: 95%" />
        <p>
          This scatter plot compares the IMDB votes and IMDB scores for the top
          3 countries - India, South Korea, and the United States of America.
          The plot shows a clear positive correlation between IMDB votes and
          IMDB scores, indicating that movies with more votes tend to have
          higher ratings. However, the relationship is not perfectly linear, as
          there is considerable scatter in the data points. From the plot, it
          appears that the movies from the United States have the highest
          concentration of data points and cover the widest range of IMDB votes
          and scores compared to the other two countries. South Korea and India
          have fewer data points, but their movies still span a wide range of
          IMDB votes and scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main cluster of data points is centered on the left range of IMDB
          votes (0 to 800,000) and the middle range of IMDB scores (between 2.0
          and 9.5). There are several outliers with extremely high IMDB vote
          counts (above 2,000,000) with high IMDB scores around 8.5-9.5. These
          may be very commercially successful movies that also received high
          critical acclaim.

      This graph, created using the Altair library, displays the number of
      content releases (movies and shows) over time by the top 3 production
      countries: the US, Korea and India. The line graph shows a steady, gradual
      increase from the 1940s to the late 1990s, followed by a sharp, almost
      vertical rise in the past two decades. The observed trends may be
      influenced by various factors, such as advancements in technology, the
      rise of streaming platforms, changes in consumer demand, and shifts in the
      entertainment industry landscape. The graph differentiates between movie
      and show releases, with the movie line (in black) and the show line (in
      red) exhibiting distinct patterns. Despite the overall surge in content
      releases, a slight retraction is evident beginning around 2020, which may
      be attributed to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Furthermore, an
      analysis of the most and least popular genres among the top three
      production countries reveals that drama and comedy content are the most
      popular, whereas genres such as western, war, and sports exhibit
      comparatively lower popularity levels.

      <span style="color: #c83c44">Interaction Guide: </span>
      To explore the network further, you can zoom in or click on specific nodes
      (points/dots) to see the names of countries. You can also investigate the
      edges (lines), which depict the connections, engagements, and interactions
      of that country with other countries. Clicking on an edge provides a
      clearer view of the connection between two specific countries, with the
      thickness indicating the frequency of interaction between them.

    <iframe
      src="country_network.html"
      frameborder="0"
      style="width: 100%; height: 800px"
    ></iframe>
    <p>
      The network visualized by the Folium library illustrates collaborations
      between countries in producing movies and shows available on Netflix. Each
      edge between two countries signifies a collaborative effort in creating
      content. Notably, certain countries exhibit high degrees within the
      network, indicating extensive collaborations with numerous other
      countries. France, Great Britain, and the USA stand out prominently in
      this regard, suggesting that the movies and shows produced by these
      nations often involve partnerships with a diverse range of international
      counterparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of particular interest is the thickness of edges, which reflects the
      frequency of collaborations between pairs of countries. The thicker the
      edge, the more frequent the collaborations. For instance, the connection
      between Great Britain and the USA appears noticeably thicker compared to
      others, indicating a robust history of joint productions between these two
      countries. Overall, the network appears dense, indicating a widespread
      network of collaborations among countries in the film and television
      industry. However, there are outliers, such as KN (Saint Kitts and Nevis)
      and LK (Sri Lanka), with a low degree of one, suggesting low collaborative
      engagements with other countries. The countries with low degree are
      located on the edge whereas the countries with high degree are located
      more in the center of the network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Analyzing this network provides valuable insights into the global dynamics
      of content creation and collaboration in the entertainment industry. It
      highlights the interconnectedness of countries in producing diverse and
      culturally rich content for platforms like Netflix, while also
      underscoring the varied levels of engagement among different nations.
    </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      Based on our static visualizations, we have noted that, on average, shows
      tend to have longer runtimes than movies. Furthermore, our analysis
      reveals that the United States receives the highest number of IMDB votes
      compared to India and Korea, indicating a potentially larger audience
      reach. Also, There are more movies than shows on Netflix in the data we
      use. There are some countries like the US whose number of movies is larger
      than the number of shows, whereas some other countries like Korea whose
      number of shows is more than the number of movies. We assume that the type
      they produce depends on the interest of the main audience. These insights
      shed light on the diverse preferences of global audiences and how Netflix
      adapts its content offerings to cater to these preferences on a
      country-by-country basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      From our data visualizations, we conclude that the US, Korea, and India
      are the top three origins of movies and shows available on Netflix. Using
      the data of the top production countries, we found that popularity via the
      number of IMDB votes led to higher IMDB scores. Outside of those top
      countries, France and Great Britain had the most collaborative productions
      around the globe. The three most common genres on Netflix are drama,
      comedy, and thriller, with a sharp increase of content throughout from
      2010s.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our future work, we will keep monitoring and collecting more recent
      data to have a more accurate understanding and visualizing of the shows
      and movies produced across different countries.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #c83c44">
      *Conclusions are made solely based on the Netflix dataset, meaning that we
      can’t generalize for all movies and shows available outside Netflix.
